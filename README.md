### Dataset Description

Yahoo! Music offers a wealth of information and services related to many aspects of music. This dataset represents a snapshot of the Yahoo! Music community's preferences for various musical items. A distinctive feature of this dataset is that user ratings are given to entities of four different types: tracks, albums, artists, and genres. In addition, the items are tied together within a hierarchy. That is, for a track we know the identity of its album, performing artist and associated genres. Similarly we have artist and genre annotation for the albums. The dataset contains ratings provided by true Yahoo Music customers during 1999-2009. Both users and items (tracks, albums, artists and genres) are represented as meaningless anonymous numbers.
